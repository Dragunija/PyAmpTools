This folder contains additional scripts that are specific to a given reaction, very likely the $\eta\pi^0\rightarrow4\gamma$ channel. These scripts can be used as a basis for other analyses
- **cfggen.py**: amptools configuration file generator
- **plotgen.py**: plotter scripts similar to [plot_etapi0](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/halld_sim/tree/master/src/programs/AmplitudeAnalysis/plot_etapi0)
- **plotgenrdf.py**: same functionality as above but uses RDataFrames
