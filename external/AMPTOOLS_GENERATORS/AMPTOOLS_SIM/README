gen_amp requires some modifications since the original version requires HDDM
- We can remove the dependence on HDDM by using a preprocessor directive
- It requires ccdb for beam information which can we can clone and build ourselves
- To convert from the executable version to class version we just need to create a header file and split gen_amp into a constructor/print_help/generate parts. The code is basically only reorganized.
