gen_amp / gen_vec_ps requires some modifications since the original version requires HDDM
- We can remove the dependence on HDDM by conditioning on a preprocessor directive: #ifdef HDDM. For future development, if needed.
- It requires ccdb for beam information which can we can clone and build ourselves
- To convert from the executable version to class version we need to
    - create an associated header file that now stores all the state variables and their default values
        - these values can be overwritten by the setatrr() python method when wrapped
    - create a void print_help method
    - create a void generate method which is likely the rest of code in the original compiled version

Why generators as classes? Original intention was to allow for more flexibility and potentially repeated calls without reloading. Also, instead of compiling gen_amp as an executable if I made it as a class, I can import it into python and parse the command line arguments there. The big downside with this approach is that I cannot simply copy from halld_sim to keep things up to date.
